# Google Drive JavaScript Projects

These projects consist of Google Drive documents, Google Sheets and Javascript in Google App Script Editor.
Each automate some task that help small companies with little projects. Some of these projects cannot be fully recreated based off of the files I have provided, much are missing the named ranges and data validation in Google Sheets that make these projects functional.

If you'd like help with implementing any of them I'd be glad to help.
