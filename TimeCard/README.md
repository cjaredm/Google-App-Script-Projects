# Google App Script Projects

Projects listed here are for a construction company I worked for and mananged their employees time cards.
We moved from paper time-cards to a Google form. The form is a link I had the employees add as a shortcut on their smart phones to clock in and out during the day. The form also includes other details about the work day used to calculate where most time is being used and what equipment.

The ClockOutReminder function is used to send a text message reminder for employees that clocked in but forgot to clock out.

The SaveToPDF function is to send an email one a month before payday to save the timecards to a PDF and back it up as an email, just in case.

The eMailReport function is to send an email report to heads of the company about current overdue balances owed and work done each week.
