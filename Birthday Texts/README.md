# Birthday Function for Google Drive

I have been using this for about the last year to automatically check a birthday spreadsheet I have of family and friends, then send them an email to their carrier's SMS email address which converts it to a text from my Gmail account.
If they use iMessage with iPhone it appears to come from my Apple ID used with iMessage and works even better, else if they reply to the message it sends an email back to my Gmail address.

Here is the shared link to a template type birthday sheet I have setup in Google Drive.
