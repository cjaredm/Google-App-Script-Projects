# Lease Reminder Email

I setup this Google Sheet for a rental company so they could have a list of all their renters and the date their lease expires. I setup a function to be ran each day or week so that it checks who's lease is expiring in a month and then sends an email out reminding them to renew their lease and their pricing options. It also leaves a timestamp note to verify it was sent.

This is a link to the sheet I have setup that includes all the data required.
